 Preq: I assume you are using a Linux or Mac box. You need to have the ports `8888` and `3000` free. (To check run from terminal : `netstat -anp | less` look for those ports and then quit). If those ports are not in use we can proceeed on the intallation.

 Installation: 

 Step1: Open a terminal. Clone the repo

 `$ git clone https://github.com/petrican/video-upload-framework`

 Step2: Change directory to `video-upload-framework`

 `$ cd video-upload-framework`

 Step3: Install dependencies
 
 `$ npm install`

 Step4: Run demo
 
 `$ npm run demo`

 At this step theoretically you should be able to have the browser opened with http://localhost:8888/webpack-dev-server/ where you can see the app.

 If that does not happen open `http://localhost:8888/webpack-dev-server/`

 Enjoy!


 Note to stop the app: `$ cd example; npm run stop` .
